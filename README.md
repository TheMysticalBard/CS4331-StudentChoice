## Overview
My name is Parker Smyrl, and I will be presenting Neuralink, a company founded by Elon Musk, the crazy guy with a car in space. Neuralink is a company that aims to develop a state of the art brain-computer interface that they call "The Link". Brain-computer interfaces, henceforth BCIs, are devices that are used to, as the name says, interface between the human brain and computers. They do this by reading the neuron activations inside of the brain, interpreting these signals, and then carrying out tasks with them.

## History
BCI research dates back to the 1970s, and the first form of BCI to hit the market was the cochlear implants of the 1980s. There have been many medical BCIs since then, mainly in the form of neuroprosthesis, but there are other BCIs like MRI scanners that greatly help diagnose patients remotely. Current BCI research, including Neuralink, is focused on medical application and restoring functionality to inabled persons.

## Neuralink History
Neuralink was founded in 2016, going public in 2017, and only recently (August 28th, 2020) did they show off their achievements so far with a live demonstration and a website update.

## Usage
I already covered some medical uses, but just to be sure, BCIs can be used for restoring function to people with disabilities. Already, there are neuroprothetics that read brain signals and allow people with lost limbs to control mechanical versions. Additionally, BCIs can detect brain damage easier than ever before, saving critial time in such cases.

When it comes to non-medical uses for BCIs, however, the possibilites really open up. A proper, full-capability BCI can read from anywhere in the brain. This is not yet possible due to the scale involved, but that is one of the challenges the Neuralink is trying to innovate on. Being able to read parts of the brain related to memory could allow humans to back up their memories virtually, and replay those moments at later dates. You could connect to your car, and drive it as if it were an extension of your body, instead of being stuck behind the wheel. You could connect with another person's BCI and share emotions, being able to tell how someone really feels regardless of language barriers. You could communicate ideas without speaking, control computers without moving, use AI alongside your brain, and even play video games just using your braing.

## VR Capabilities
Since a true BCI has full access to the brain, it could be used to send sensory information regardless of the external stimuli. The BCI could make you truly feel as if you were in the virtual world. Even with state-of-the-art VR addons, none can make you taste virtual food like a BCI would be able to. This extends beyond VR as well. AR applications could send sensory information to the BCI while you still maintain most of your regular senses. You could pet a virtual pet sitting next to you in the real world, and truly feel it.

## Issues
The technology is incredibly new, with Neuralink only aiming at clinical trials next year. The first VR applications won't be coming out for a very long time. We also don't have enough knowledge of the brain signals. In order to do anything with the BCI, the signals have to be interpreted correctly. We simply don't know how the brain's many functions all work yet. BCIs themselves will help us understand these signals, but we are a long way from being able to store memories for example.

BCIs also have an intense tradeoff between how invasive they are and how much information they can gather. Neuralink's BCI is an invasive BCI, meaning its wires are directly inserted into the brain. The company is developing a robot that can perform the surgery to install the links entirely safely, but it has not been finished and regardless, surgery will still be required to install.

When a true BCI is used for VR, there would be no simulator sickness. The signals sent from the device would be indistinguishable from the signals your brain would produce in the real world. This does lead to another potential issue, and that would be the blurring between the real and virtual worlds. People may get confused as to which world they are in, leading to many problems legally and socially.

## Similar Applications and Other
Similar applications include BrainGate, another company developing BCIs that is also aiming at general use after clinical applications. Trying to finish going down this list of requirements, Neuralink's BCI has zero motion sickness, can be used for applications far into the future, tracks anyhing that has brain activity such as body positions (eye, hand, and more), and can even produce smells. While you can't exactly insert a phone into a BCI, they can be used to synchronize with your phone, allowing remote control using just your brain. This is another thing that Neuralink has already envisioned and has simulations for phone games being controlled via the brain.

## Conclusion
I wanted to end on Gertrude the pig, the star of the live Neuralink presentation. She has an implant already in her, and none of the other pigs can even tell. She behaves the same and is just as happy as the rest of them, just look at that smile! Overall, Neuralink and BCIs are paving the way to a bright future where neurological diseases no longer exist and humans can access truly immersive experiences with only a few minutes of surgery. VR is but a small part of BCIs, but BCIs may be the final form of true virtual realities.
